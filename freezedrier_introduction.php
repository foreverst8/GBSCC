		<p>The freeze dryer technology is a water removal procedure used to preserve perishable materials, with an aim to increase the material’s shelf life and/or prepare them for transport. Freeze drying is the process of freezing the materials, then decreasing the pressure and adding heat to transform frozen water in the material to change into a vapor (sublimate).
